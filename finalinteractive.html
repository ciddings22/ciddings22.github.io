	<p id="releaseinfo">Highway Tune was their debut single and was released on March 31, 2017. It was available in the U.S. and Canada and topped the charts in the U.S. It was the very first song the band had ever written and recorded together, with the guitar riff being written as far back as 2010, before the band had even formed, and was later reformatted and demoed twice after the band had been formed.</p>
